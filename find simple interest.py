# Principal amount
principal = 200
# Annual interest rate (in percentage)
rate = 5
# Time period (in years)
time = 5
# Calculate simple interest
simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
# Print the result
print("Simple Interest: Rs.", simple_interest)

#Output
#Simple Interest: Rs. 50.0
